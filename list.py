# List stacks
# Basic assumption here is that you have permissions to access the AWS resources.
# You can use the AWS CLI to check the permissions.
# You can use the AWS CloudFormation console to check the stack status.
# boto3 is used to access the AWS resources and needs to be installed.
# Please be free to use it in your own projects and feel free to modify it, improve it and share it.
